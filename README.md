# Pokedex-
This here is a Pokemon encyclopedia. This program will give you information for the first 151 Pokemons. 
Make sure you install the playsound package on python. To do so search "Anaconda Prompt" and type "pip install playsound".
I highly recomend you download the masterfile so you can have everything at once and yoy could be able to run the program properly without having yo change anything.
